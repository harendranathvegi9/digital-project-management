# How Project Planning Works

Planning can be tedious and unglamorous - but if you skip it, you'll end up wasting a lot of time on trial and error. Even if a plan proves useless, the act of planning is indispensable because it clarifies the goal and serves as a starting point.

Before you start planning to-dos, time, and people, you need a consistent way to organize your work. Projects have a lot of tasks and you have several options by which you can group them:

- **Progress**: Backlog, Next, In-Progress, Review, Done
- **Type of Work**: Design, Marketing, Development, QA
- **Time**: Today, This Week, Next Week, May 2016, To Be Determined
- **Product**: Website, Mobile App, Desktop App, Blog
- **Feature**: Homepage, Contact Us, Header, Footer, Shopping Cart
- **Priority**: Low, Routine, Normal, Priority, Critical, DEFCON 1
- **Complexity**: Quick Fix, Minor Improvement, Big Feature, Security, Tech Debt
- **Hybrid**: a mix of the above

The way you group tasks depends on the project. For **continuous projects** that have no beginning and no end (like developing your own product), it's best to organize tasks by progress and projects by product. **Small-scale projects** (like website development) can be grouped by feature, while **bigger projects** (like a complete rebranding) are commonly grouped by the type of work.

There are two approaches on how granular you want to go when grouping tasks: you can use simple segmentation and complex segmentation.

When in doubt, **go with the most flexible approach** and see how it works. Over time, you'll know which tasks are the most frequent and you’ll know when to use which principle. For example, if you complete tasks as soon as you start working on them (there’s are no complicated processes, just simple to-dos), grouping them by progress is useless; what you then need is to group by time or priority.

If your workflow is good, but you occasionally come across a task that demands it’s own category, just add a column where you’ll put all the odd jobs. You can also use the hybrid approach: if you categorize by complexity, feel free to add the In-Progress column. But don't overdo it. It can be confusing if you use more than one principle: for instance, does a new bug go into Backlog, Hot Fix, Development, or Feature A?

The problem of segmenting tasks more granularity is addressed by using **swimlanes**, but they bring more confusion than clarity because they make the flow non-sequential. For example, you need to segment both design and development phases into Planning, In-Progress, and Review. But with swimlanes, it's hard to track work items and a developer doesn’t know what tasks he can pull next.
 
A better solution is to break a task list into several task lists so the flow is straight and manageable.

When deciding on how you want to organize tasks, keep in mind all the tools you have at your disposal and how you can retrieve information.

Active Collab offers a solution for this - a task has several filterable fields. It practically means you don't have to organize task lists by time or assignee because you can always get those dimensions automatically. 

If you need more to segment tasks using more dimensions (eg. want to mark task as a bug that’s in-progress with a high complexity), use **labels** in addition to task lists. Labels are like tags and can be anything you want; one task can contain multiple labels. You can communicate a task’s complexity, type of work, priority, or anything else by using them. This way, task lists don't have to do so much work.

For example, if you organize task lists by feature, you can use labels to indicate progress. When you start working on a task, just switch the label to In-Progress; when you’re done, switch the label to Review.

To recap: use task lists to group tasks by one principle (usually stage of progress or type of work), and add labels if you need more information. You can always filter tasks by assignee and date automatically when needed.
